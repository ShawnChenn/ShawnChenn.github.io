## Summary
StyleGAN has easily accessible and accurate representations of intrinsic images. Simply by finding an appropriate offset to the latent variables for each type, we make StyleGAN reveal intrinsic images of many types for a synthesized image, including: surface normal, depth maps, albedo, shading, segmentation. 

No new weight learning or fine-tuning is required.

## Problem Statement
whethter StyleGAN knows and represents intrinsic images.

## Methodology
present a new approach for modeling natural oscillation dynamics from a single still picture. 
Our image-space motion prior is represented with spectral volumes, a frequency representation of per-pixel motion trajectories, which we find to be efficient and effective for prediction with diffusion models, and which we learn from collections of real world videos. 

## To me, new knowledge
- It is conceptually exciting that an image generator should “know” and represent intrinsic images. 

- The intrinsic images obtained from StyleGAN compare well both qualitatively and quantitatively with those obtained by using SOTA image regression techniques.

- StyleGAN’s intrinsic images are robust to relighting effects, unlike SOTA methods

## Personal Thoughts
- Other generative models
More powerful/capable models have better intrisic images?

- Practical advantages to using a generative model to produce intrinsic images.
